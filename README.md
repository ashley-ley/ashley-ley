# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ashley Ley!
I'm a junior data analyst with a passion for leveraging data to drive positive change everywhere I go! Here's a bit more about me:

# ðŸ‘€ Interests: 
My interests lie in education, healthcare and contributing to initiatives that make the world a better place.

# ðŸŒ± Currently Learning: 
I'm actively expanding my skill set by learning Python, SQL, Tableau, JavaScript and more. I'm also comfortable working with databases like PostgreSQL and enjoy using tools like Jupyter Notebook and Leaflet to write code and visualize data.

# Projects 
Now that you know a bit about me, let's explore some of the projects and repositories I've been working on:

* Map-data-analysis: 6th Grade students in a nearby school district have displayed consistent growth from 2016-2023 by taking the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) test three times annually. My findings include analysis breakdown by teacher; showing MAP score averages per test period and additional analyses with student demographic information.

* Travel-bucket-list: There are so many places I'd like to travel! I compiled a layered map that allows viewers to view my bucket list of travels and their country's population density.

* Mars-weather-analysis: The Curiousity Rover collected data about the weather on Mars. The coldest and warmest months were March and August respectively. 

Feel free to browse my repositories and explore the code. If you'd like to collaborate, have questions, or just want to connect, you can reach me at yakopeca@gmail.com
